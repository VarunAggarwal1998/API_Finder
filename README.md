## Problem Statement
The specific project for this semester aims to develop a system that can read API /JSON data and produce results to some application. 
For the purpose of this exercise, we should aim at creating a small and manageable local database based on the downloaded data. 
Our aim was to make an API finder using Java Programming language by inserting the data from a public API, (which consists of list of free public APIs in raw JSON format) into our local database and then performing various operations on it like:
•	Retrieving the data<br>
•	Adding new data<br>
•	Updating the existing data<br>
•	Deleting the data that is not required<br>
•	Searching the data through the keyword<br>

## Installation and Configuration
•	Firstly clone the fully developed code from the GitHub using the command git clone or download the project in zip file<br>
•	Import the project in the latest version of the eclipse<br>
•       Download the Jar files and configure them in the build path of the project in eclipse<br>
•	Create a local database in MYSQL Workbench and create a table using the following query:<br>

•	Modify the context.xml file under src/webapp/META-INF by configuring the Resource name , username, and password.<be>
•	Run the project b clicking Run as --> Run on Server  and then select apache Tomcat v.9.0+<br>
•	The project UI will open in localhost:8080/ on any web browser.<br>

## Software Requirements
•	JDK v 12.0+<br>
•	Eclipse latest version<br>
•	Apache Tomcat v 9.0+<br>
•	MSQL Workbench<br>
•	UML<br>
