			<p>API is short for Application Programming Interface. An API is an intermediary that relays communication between two programs in a format each respective application can interpret. This allows owners to expose a part of the product's functionality to third parties while keeping the rest of the application safe.</p>
			<p>At Api Finder, we use APIs a lot.

But we find that a lot of APIs are locked behind a paywall, which can make API testing a bit difficult to do - luckily, free APIs do exist. With the help of a free API, you can do testing and create flexible, powerful apps in record time.
With a quick Google search, youâ€™ll discover tens of thousands of free and open APIs - all well-made and easily accessible to developers all over the world. But with so many APIs to choose from, looking for one that fits your needs can be incredibly time-consuming. So we combed the web with a simple goal in mind - to make a comprehensive list of the best free APIs.
